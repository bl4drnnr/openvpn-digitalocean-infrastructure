### Introduction

**OpenVPN** - is a virtual private network system that implements techniques to create secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities. It implements both client and server applications.

**DigitalOcean** - is an American cloud infrastructure provider. DigitalOcean provides developers, startups, and SMBs with cloud **infrastructure-as-a-service** (or just **IaaS**) platforms.

**Terraform** - is an open-source, infrastructure as code, software tool created by HashiCorp. Users define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON.

The presented project presents **OpenVPN** infrastructure build on **DigitalOcean** with help of **Terraform** IaaS programming language. Bellow will be described:

- the diagram of the whole built virtual privagte network with devices
- step-by-step instruction on how to implement it using **Terraform** (this repository) and on your own
- detailed information about **TLS/SSL, HTTPS, certificates, key pairs** etc.

Happy reading!
